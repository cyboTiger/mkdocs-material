# Neural Network Pruning
Make neural network smaller by removing synapses and neurons

# Pruning at Different Granularities

# Pruning Criterion
## Selection of Synapses to Prune
+ When removing neurons from a neural network model, 
    + the less useful the neurons being removed are, 
    + the better the performance of pruned neural network is.

### Magnitude-based Pruning
### Second-Order-based Pruning
### Percentage-of-Zero-Based Pruning
### Regression-based Pruning
