??? note "writing type rubric"
    ## Integrated Writing Rubric
    A response at this level successfully selects the important information from the lecture and coherently and accurately presents this information in relation to the relevant information presented in the reading. The response is well organized, and occasional language errors that are present do not result in inaccurate or imprecise presentation of content or connections.

    ## Writing for an Academic Discussion Rubric
    The response is a relevant and very clearly expressed contribution to the online discussion, and it demonstrates consistent facility in the use of language. A typical response displays the following: 

    + Relevant and well-elaborated explanations, exemplifications, and/or details

    + Effective use of a variety of syntactic structures and precise, idiomatic word choice

    + Almost no lexical or grammatical errors other than those expected from a competent writer writing under timed conditions(e.g., common typos or common misspellings or substitutions like there/their)
